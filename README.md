# Mercury Platform

Mercury is a financial analysis platform that facilitates quick and easy algorithmic analysis of market data. Named (at least temporarily) after the Roman God of Commerce.

The initial implementation aims to provide a way to provide burstable quantitative analysis with no/minimal permanent infrastructure costs.

## Goals
1. Create a platform that provides an easy interface for testing hypotheses about financial market trends utilizing EOD data
1. Process existing algorithms on a daily basis analyzing the most recent EOD data
1. Allow for new theories to be tested on a larger historical data set in a distributed and parallel manner
1. Accomplish the above using cloud-native tooling

## Constraints
- Minimal permanent infrastructure

## Roadmap
[ ] Brainstorm potential architecture patterns

[ ] Build a system for retrieving and storing financial data in an economical and sustainable way

[ ] (If necessary) Clean data from sources and output a format consumable by our analysis tools

[ ] Design an extensible system that can execute new algorithms and analyses against market data

[ ] Develop the infrastructure patterns necessary to handle distributed workloads
